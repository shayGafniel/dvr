This is a readme file for tool tip component

First applied at expedite component.

Motivation behind this component is to indicate the user when it might fill fields incorrectly.

The Idea is to call Mitch service each time user enters or changes field value and get from it a QA report.

The report should be mapped to the relevant and then passed to the component as input.

For design look at:

https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/JADCPOD2D#/screens


API:

@Input() hintsList: Array<string> // the QA messages accepted from Mitch (or any other QA service) as html un-ordered list (orange font).
@Input() question: string // A comment for the user below the QA messages (black font).

@Input() stylesUpdateTrigger: Observable<any> // the components subscribes for this observable and rendered its content and style on change

example:
<common-bo-tool-tip-pop-up [hintsList]="['Currency is too old.', 'Currency is too weird.']" [question]="'Are you sure this is the right currency?'"
                                    [stylesUpdateTrigger]="currenciesMessages"></common-bo-tool-tip-pop-up>
